##What is it

Private chat for two, easily deployable to heroku, and beautiful css (with transitions of course:D!!)


##Version

1.0.0.20.4.6
>just for fun purposes i kept it long:-)

##Tech (now i am talking!)

This app uses many libraries to run properly

   - [EJS] -  It cleans the HTML out of your JavaScript with client side templates(hmm! useful for me!)
   - [express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
   - [socket.io] - enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.
   - [gravatar] - Your Gravatar is an image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog. (looks helpful!)

##Installation (pay attention, Luke:D )

Just git bash or terminal bash on this project directory with npm install

```sh
$ npm install
```

##Running It

Just run it!!!!

```sh
$ node app.js
```

###AND

By 'THE' way if u want the u can hack it ~~a bit~~ and try to add multiple users, ur welcome
